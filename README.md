# Albums

## [2018 - Madness](<2018 - Madness/>)

Album released in 2018 with my first electronic music experimentations, mostly atmospheric, accompanied by a series of edited pictures to accompany each song as well as a digipack release.

## [2021 - Crumbling Path](<2021 - Crumbling Path/>)

Album released in 2021, using more advanced sound effects than the previous album.
The tracks go from a rather atmospheric start towards a more aggressive and chaotic end.

## [2021 - Descent](<2021 - Descent>)

Album released in 2021, the most simple of all the albums so far, containing only two slow and atmospheric tracks using mostly piano.
